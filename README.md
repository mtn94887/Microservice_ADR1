Title: Microservices Architecture for Budget Management Application

## Context

Our company is developing a budget management application to help individuals and businesses track their finances. This application is expected to handle a large volume of users and transactions. We need a scalable and maintainable architecture to support the growing demands of our user base and to enable easy development and deployment of new features.

## Decision

We will design the budget management application using a microservices architecture. Each functional component of the application will be implemented as a separate microservice, responsible for a specific aspect of the budget management process, such as user authentication, transaction tracking, budget planning, and reporting.

## Rationale

A microservices architecture offers several advantages for our budget management application:
    Scalability: Microservices allow us to scale individual components independently based on demand. This flexibility is crucial for handling varying workloads efficiently,     especially during peak usage periods.
    Flexibility: With microservices, different teams can use the most appropriate technologies and programming languages for each service. This enables us to leverage the strengths of various tools and frameworks, optimizing development and maintenance efforts.
    Maintainability: By decoupling components into separate services, we can make changes, updates, and bug fixes to one service without affecting others. This modular approach simplifies maintenance and reduces the risk of unintended side effects.
    Resilience: In a microservices architecture, failure in one service does not necessarily bring down the entire system. Other services can continue to function independently, ensuring uninterrupted service availability for users.

## Consequences

    Complexity: Managing a distributed system introduces additional complexity in terms of deployment, monitoring, and coordination between services. We need to invest in robust DevOps practices and tooling to effectively manage this complexity.
    Communication Overhead: Inter-service communication introduces latency and network overhead, which must be carefully managed to ensure acceptable performance. We'll employ lightweight communication protocols like gRPC or RESTful APIs and implement efficient service discovery mechanisms to minimize overhead.
    Data Consistency: Ensuring data consistency and transactional integrity across multiple microservices requires careful design and implementation of distributed transactions or eventual consistency mechanisms. We'll adopt patterns like Saga or CQRS to maintain consistency while preserving scalability and performance.

## Sample code

Here are the sample codes for the Hotel Booking System that uses microservices. 

**AuthenticationService.java**
```
public interface AuthenticationService {
    public String authenticateUser(String username, String password);
    public boolean isUserAuthenticated(String token);
    public String logoutUser(String token);
}
```

**BookingService.java**
```
public interface BookingService {
    public String bookRoom(String hotelId, String userId,Booking booking);
    public Booking getBookingById(String bookingId);
    public List<Booking> getAllBooking();
    public String cancelBooking(String bookingId);
    public String completeBooking(String bookingId);
}
```

**PaymentService.java**
```
public interface PaymentService {
    public String makePayment(String userId, Payment payment);
    public Payment getPaymentById(String paymentId);
    public String cancelPayment(String paymentId);
    public String refundPayment(String paymentId);
}
```

**HotelFoodService.java**
```
public interface HotelFoodService {
    public List<FoodItem> getAllFoodItems();
    public FoodItem getFoodItemById(String foodItemId);
    public String orderFood(String userId, String foodItemId, int quantity);
    public String cancelFoodOrder(String orderId);
    public List<String> getAvailableFoodCategories();
    public List<FoodItem> getFoodItemsByCategory(String category);
}
```
